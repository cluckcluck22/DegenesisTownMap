            <p>Down a back alley and around a corner is where you can find Jasmine’s Herbal Remedies. If that doesn’t help, follow your nose, you’re bound to find the right place. Although a recent addition to Raven’s claw, this small shop built into a row of townhouses is already a staple of the local community. From medicinal to culinary, Jasmine grows and serves a wide variety of planets for almost any occasion.<br><br>

Upon entering her shop, one would find themselves overwhelmed by the smell of drying herbs and budding plants, with almost any free space being taken up by one form of plant or another. The only floor space left clear is a strait path from the door to the counter from which business will take place. Behind it one will most likely find Jasmine herself, muddling away over a cauldron prepping something or another.
